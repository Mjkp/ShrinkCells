This is the repository for the ShrinkCells Generator in Rhino3D used in the UIST 2022 paper "ShrinkCells: Localized and Sequential Shape-Changing Actuation of 3D-Printed Objects via Selective Heating". Additionally we included STL samples with power supply details. 


## Materials

Protopasta and SMP filament is used for this study
1) Protopasta https://www.proto-pasta.com/products/conductive-pla
2) SMP filament http://www.smptechno.com/index_en.html
   
## Slicer
Ultimaker Cura (https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura) is used for this study, yet any slicer should work

## Power Supply details
Rhode&Schwarz NGA100 Series (https://www.rohde-schwarz.com/us/products/test-and-measurement/dc-power-supplies/rs-nga100-power-supply-series_63493-959872.html) is used for this study. However, any power supply with sufficient output power should be fine.

Incase you want to controll the power supply as we did in our study please refer to Rhode&Schwarz helper code (https://github.com/makinteractlab/RohdeSchwarzControlSoftware).
